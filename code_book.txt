In summary, the data set is a collection of measurements from the accelerometer and gyroscope of
a mobile device while subjects were performing certain activities. The final format for this modified
data set is the mean of each of the calculated means/standard deviations for each measurement in the
original data set. The means are calculated over a grouping of each subject/activity pair.
